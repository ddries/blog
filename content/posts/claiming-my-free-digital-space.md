I created this website because I wanted a personal space on the internet. The internet is a vast, chaotic collection of websites, social media platforms, human interactions, emotions, desires, and ideas. To me, it's the most valuable invention humankind has ever made. That's why I felt the need to carve out a little corner in this immense digital universe—a place where my digital self can exist and where I can express myself freely.

However, it seems we’ve lost sight of what the internet truly is. At its core, it’s simply the connection between computers. Those computers talking to each other creates the brilliant consequence of being able to communicate with anybody around the world, regardless of who we are or what our interests might be.

In essence, the internet represents the human right to free communication. We should not (and cannot) allow our online activities to be dictated by corporations we have no control over. Unfortunately, that’s the reality we face today —a world where Big Tech dominates and monetizes the internet.

Despite this, there’s still hope for the digital world. There are people who believe in a better future, people who are willing to fight for it. The world needs competent individuals who are committed to improving our society, our world, and our internet. These are my beliefs, and these are the ideas and feelings I want to share in this blog.

I’m not sure how long I’ll keep writing this blog, but I hope it lasts for a while. If you’ve somehow stumbled upon this blog and resonate with its message or content, feel free to bookmark the site or contact me via email.
